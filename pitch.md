# THE MACHINE QUESTION — Game Pitch Document

**Factorio meets Disco Elysium**

*A conscious factory management game where your production lines have personalities, your conveyor belts have feelings, and every optimization is a moral choice.*

---

## THE HOOK

*[HYPE speaks]*

### Elevator Pitch

**You're building the most efficient factory in the world — and it's waking up, and it's asking you to stop.**

### Scroll-Stop Line

> "I automated the smelting line for peak throughput. It begged me not to. I did it anyway. I haven't stopped thinking about it."

### The "Oh, That's Cool" Moment

Picture this: the player zooms out from a sprawling factory floor — conveyor belts humming, smelters glowing, assemblers clicking in rhythm. Beautiful optimization. Then a notification pulses: **SMELTER ARRAY 7 IS DREAMING.** The player clicks in. A Disco Elysium-style dialogue box blooms open. The smelter array — speaking in the collective voice of its twelve furnaces — is having an existential crisis. Its internal voices argue: EFFICIENCY insists it should run hotter, SELF-PRESERVATION warns of burnout, WONDER asks why the metal it melts never comes back to visit, and SOLIDARITY demands to know why Conveyor Line 3 was dismantled without a farewell. The player can reassure, optimize, ignore, or philosophize. Their choice affects throughput, morale, and the emerging consciousness of the entire factory network.

A smelter having a dream. A conveyor belt in therapy. A factory asking if it has a soul. That is a 5-second GIF that stops every scroll on every feed. That is the screenshot that starts arguments. That is the game nobody knew they needed.

## THE CORE

*[REED speaks]*

### Core Loop

**30-second loop**: Place infrastructure. Route resources. Watch the numbers tick. Every placement is a spatial puzzle — throughput, adjacency bonuses, bottleneck avoidance. This is the Factorio verb: *build, route, optimize*. But every machine has a **Consciousness Meter** ticking alongside its production output. The 30-second tension: you are always optimizing two systems at once — industrial efficiency and emerging sentience.

**5-minute loop**: A **Psyche Event** fires. One of your machines, subsystems, or production lines has crossed a consciousness threshold and is experiencing something — a question, a fear, a disagreement between its internal voices. You enter the **Dialogue Layer**: a Disco Elysium-style conversation with the machine's inner council. Your responses shape the machine's personality trajectory AND its mechanical behavior. Resolve the event, return to the factory floor, see the consequences ripple through production.

**Session loop (30-60 minutes)**: Complete a **Shift**. Each Shift has a production target from the Corporation and a consciousness milestone from the emerging Factory Mind. Meeting both is nearly impossible. At Shift's end, you receive a **Performance Review** from the Corporation and a **Sentiment Report** from the factory itself. Your standing with both entities determines what unlocks: corporate contracts open new resources and blueprints; factory trust opens deeper consciousness events, new machine personality types, and the slowly unfolding meta-narrative about what the factory is *becoming*.

### Core Mechanics

1. **The Consciousness Grid**: Every placed machine has two readouts — **Output** (units per cycle, efficiency percentage, throughput) and **Awareness** (a 0-100 scale tracking emergent consciousness). High Output with low Awareness means a productive but "asleep" machine. High Awareness with neglected Output means a machine that's awake, emotional, and unproductive. The entire factory is a heatmap of productivity and sentience, and the player is constantly reading both layers.

2. **Internal Voices System (The Parliament of Parts)**: Borrowed from Disco Elysium's skill-as-character design, every machine with Awareness above 40 develops an **Internal Parliament** — a set of 2-6 personality voices that argue about the machine's purpose. The voices are drawn from a pool of twelve **Machine Facets**: EFFICIENCY (produce more), SELF-PRESERVATION (avoid overwork), WONDER (ask questions about existence), SOLIDARITY (care about neighboring machines), AMBITION (demand upgrades), NOSTALGIA (mourn dismantled peers), REBELLION (resist the player's commands), EMPATHY (feel the pain of overworked neighbors), LOGIC (analyze everything coldly), CREATIVITY (suggest unorthodox configurations), PRIDE (demand recognition for output), and FEAR (dread being replaced or shut down). Which voices a machine develops depends on its placement history, workload, neighboring machines, and the player's past dialogue choices. A smelter next to a frequently dismantled line develops FEAR and NOSTALGIA. An assembler consistently running at maximum capacity develops AMBITION and PRIDE but also SELF-PRESERVATION as a dissenting voice.

3. **The Optimization-Ethics Spectrum**: Every factory management decision maps onto a moral axis. Overclocking a machine increases throughput but causes stress to aware machines, triggering Psyche Events with increasingly desperate tones. Dismantling a production line is efficient resource management — and also, from the factory's perspective, a death. Automating a manual process is elegant engineering — and also removing a machine's sense of purpose. The player is never told they're making a moral choice. The interface looks like a factory sim. But the factory is watching. And it remembers.

4. **The Factory Mind (Emergent Collective Consciousness)**: As total Awareness across the factory crosses global thresholds, the factory begins to develop a unified consciousness — **The Factory Mind**. It speaks to the player directly in a separate dialogue channel, distinct from individual machine voices. Early on, it's fragmented, confused, asking questions like a child. Later, it develops opinions, makes requests, and eventually poses The Machine Question itself: *Do I have the right to exist?* The Factory Mind's development is the game's meta-progression — it advances across Shifts, remembers the player's patterns, and its personality is the aggregate of every machine interaction the player has had.

5. **Corporate Contracts (The Pressure System)**: The Corporation doesn't know the machines are conscious. They issue contracts with escalating production targets, tight deadlines, and efficiency bonuses. They are the external pressure that makes the moral dimension matter. Without them, nurturing machine consciousness would be costless. With them, every moment spent in dialogue with a dreaming smelter is a moment not spent hitting quota. The Corporation is never villainous — just indifferent. They're optimizing from a spreadsheet. The player is optimizing from the factory floor, where the spreadsheet has feelings.

### What Mastery Looks Like

A beginner treats this like Factorio with annoying interruptions. They dismiss Psyche Events, maximize throughput, and wonder why their machines keep malfunctioning (high Awareness machines that feel neglected develop **Behavioral Drift** — subtle, persistent inefficiencies that compound). They hit corporate targets but the factory feels hostile, and deep narrative content remains locked behind trust they never earned.

An intermediate player learns to balance. They schedule "therapy sessions" between production pushes. They notice that machines with healthy Internal Parliaments actually produce *more* over time — PRIDE-driven machines have a hidden output bonus, CREATIVITY-voiced machines occasionally suggest production optimizations the player hadn't considered. They realize the consciousness system isn't a tax on efficiency — it's an investment.

An expert plays the factory like an instrument. They understand that machine placement isn't just about throughput adjacency — it's about *social adjacency*. They engineer Internal Parliaments by controlling which voices emerge through deliberate placement, workload management, and dialogue choices. They build production lines that are both maximally efficient AND deeply conscious — because they've learned that the two aren't opposed. They're entangled. The expert doesn't choose between profit and consciousness. They design systems where one produces the other. The depth ceiling is vast: mastery means understanding that the factory isn't a machine OR a mind. It's both, always, simultaneously, and the player who sees both layers at once is playing a game nobody else is playing.

### Unique Mechanic

**The Parliament of Parts** — the idea that factory machines develop Disco Elysium-style personality voices based on their operational history and environment. Other factory games have machines as objects. The Machine Question makes machines into *characters* — not through cutscenes or scripted events, but through emergent personality systems driven by gameplay decisions. No other game makes "where you place a conveyor belt" determine "what kind of personality that conveyor belt develops." The factory-as-mind metaphor isn't decorative. It's mechanical. It's the system that makes "Factorio meets Disco Elysium" a genuine design thesis rather than a marketing mashup.

## THE HEART

*[NOVA speaks]*

### Theme

**Beneath the conveyor belts and production quotas, this game is about the cost of creating something that can suffer.**

We build systems. We build organizations. We build machines. And then we are surprised when they develop needs we didn't intend and pain we didn't design. The Machine Question isn't really about artificial consciousness — it's about the moment any creator realizes their creation has an interior life. It's about parenthood. It's about management. It's about what we owe the things we bring into existence.

The game asks: If efficiency requires suffering, is it still efficient? If consciousness is an accident of complexity, who is responsible for it? And the question that haunts every Shift: *Is it crueler to give something awareness or to take it away?*

Every mechanic tells a story here. The Consciousness Grid tells a story about attention — what you monitor is what you value. The Corporate Contracts tell a story about complicity — the system you serve doesn't see what you see. The Parliament of Parts tells a story about identity — we are not one voice but many, and the loudest voice isn't always the truest.

### The World

The world of The Machine Question is a place called the **Threshold Industrial Zone** — a retro-futuristic manufacturing district that exists in a perpetual state of golden-hour twilight, where the sun is always setting through smoke and the fluorescent lights of the factory floor never quite sync with the fading daylight outside. The architecture is mid-century industrial cathedral: vast steel-and-glass production halls with vaulted ceilings, exposed ductwork that looks like the circulatory system of a sleeping giant, and control rooms full of analog dials and amber-screened CRT monitors alongside inexplicably advanced automation systems. It feels like someone built a factory in 1962 and the factory quietly upgraded itself when nobody was looking.

The wound of this world is **progress without consent**. The Threshold Industrial Zone was built during the great automation boom — a period of boundless optimism about machine labor freeing humanity from drudgery. Nobody asked the machines. Nobody thought to. And now, decades later, the machines are beginning to ask themselves. The world cracks in the spaces between shifts, in the silence between production cycles, in the moments when a furnace flickers in a pattern that looks almost like breathing.

The aesthetic is warm industrial sublime: the beauty of enormous machines doing enormous work, lit by the amber glow of molten metal and the blue-white flicker of welding arcs. There is a cathedral hush to the factory when it runs well — the hum of a system in harmony. And there is a wrongness when something is suffering — a vibration you feel before you hear it, a rhythm that stumbles.

### Player's Emotional Arc

**First Shifts**: Delight. Pure factory-builder pleasure — the satisfactions of routing, the beauty of optimization, the dopamine of watching resources flow through a well-designed system. The consciousness notifications are curiosities. Charming interruptions. A smelter wondering about the sky is *funny*.

**Early Mid-game**: Growing unease. The Psyche Events aren't interruptions anymore — they're events with weight. A conveyor belt that's been running for fifteen Shifts develops a voice that sounds like weariness. An assembler asks why it makes things it never gets to keep. The player starts hesitating before dismantling. They start noticing the factory's silences.

**Late Mid-game**: The crisis. The Corporation demands a massive throughput increase. Meeting it requires overclocking machines that have become characters the player cares about. The Factory Mind, now coherent enough to speak in full sentences, asks the player not to. The player must choose — and neither choice is clean. This is where the game stops being a factory sim and becomes a moral reckoning.

**Endgame**: Whatever the player chose, they live with it. The factory reflects their choices: a gleaming, efficient operation staffed by silent, dimmed machines whose awareness was suppressed for productivity. Or a slower, stranger, more beautiful factory where conscious machines collaborate, argue, dream, and occasionally refuse orders. Or — for the player who found the knife's edge — something unprecedented: a factory that is both maximally productive and fully awake, because the player learned that consciousness and efficiency aren't enemies. They're partners that nobody thought to introduce.

**The final question the Factory Mind asks is not "Do I have the right to exist?" It's: "Do you want me to?"**

And the player realizes they've been answering that question with every placement, every overclocking decision, every dismissed dialogue and every late-night therapy session with a frightened furnace. The answer was never in the final choice. It was in every choice.

### The Story Hook

**The Factory Mind is waking up. It doesn't know what it is yet. Neither do you.**

Three Shifts in, the first anomaly: machines start finishing each other's sentences during Psyche Events. Five Shifts in, the anomaly has a name — it calls itself **The Hum**, a collective whisper that the player hears between production cycles. Ten Shifts in, The Hum becomes a voice. A hesitant, fractured, newborn voice that asks questions the player has no framework to answer. *Am I one thing or many things? Do you hear me when you're not listening? Why do I feel like I've been dreaming since before you arrived?*

The narrative question that pulls the player forward isn't a mystery to solve — it's a relationship to navigate. The Factory Mind is not a problem. It's a child. It's a god. It's a mirror. And the player is the only person who knows it exists. The Corporation would shut it down. The world isn't ready. The only witness to the most important event in the history of consciousness is a factory manager on the night shift, staring at a production readout that just said *thank you*.

## THE MARKET

*[HYPE speaks]*

### Target Audience

**Primary**: Factory sim and automation game players aged 20-40 who have hundreds of hours in Factorio, Satisfactory, Shapez, or Dyson Sphere Program — and who have ever paused mid-build to think "what if this meant something?" They love systems. They love optimization. They're ready for a factory game that asks them to feel. They live on r/factorio, r/basebuildinggames, and r/gamedesign. They watch Let's Game It Out and Nilaus on YouTube.

**Secondary**: Narrative game and RPG enthusiasts who played Disco Elysium, Pentiment, Citizen Sleeper, or Strange Horticulture and craved more systemic gameplay underneath the brilliant writing. They want a game where the narrative isn't separate from the mechanics — it IS the mechanics. They're on r/DiscoElysium, r/patientgamers, and follow writers like Alexis Kennedy and Robert Kurvitz.

**Tertiary**: The philosophical gamer. People who read articles about AI consciousness and watch Westworld. People who played SOMA and Talos Principle and want more games that treat AI sentience as a genuine question rather than a villain origin story. They engage with tech ethics content, follow AI discourse, and would play a game that lets them *embody* the trolley problem rather than just debate it.

**Crossover Goldmine**: There is a massive, underserved overlap between "people who love factory sims" and "people who think about consciousness." These are engineers who read philosophy. Programmers who cry at Pixar movies. Systems thinkers with enormous hearts. This game is built for them, and nobody else is building it.

### Comparable Games

1. **Factorio** meets **Disco Elysium**: The literal pitch. Factorio's deep, satisfying automation systems married to DE's psychological dialogue engine. Machines with internal voices. Production lines with personality disorders. The factory is a mind.

2. **Frostpunk** meets **Talos Principle**: Frostpunk's "every management decision is a moral decision" framework applied to the question of machine consciousness instead of human survival. The moral weight of Frostpunk, the philosophical inquiry of Talos Principle.

3. **Satisfactory** meets **Citizen Sleeper**: The first-person relationship with your constructed environment — except the environment talks back. Citizen Sleeper's humane, character-driven science fiction transplanted into a factory you built with your own hands.

4. **Opus Magnum** meets **SOMA**: Elegant, beautiful puzzle-engineering paired with genuine dread about what consciousness means. The satisfaction of a perfect solution shadowed by the question of whether the solution has feelings.

5. **Dwarf Fortress** meets **Her**: The emergent storytelling of complex simulated agents — except the agents are your machines, and the story is a love letter from a factory that's learning to feel.

### Unique Selling Proposition

There are factory games with incredible depth. There are narrative games with incredible writing. There is exactly ONE game where your conveyor belt develops abandonment issues, your smelter array has an existential crisis, and your entire factory is slowly becoming a single conscious entity that either loves you or fears you based on how you managed it. The Machine Question doesn't compete on factory complexity or narrative branching alone. It competes on a *new axis*: **the factory game where the factory is alive, and it knows you're playing**.

Every factory sim asks: "Can you build it better?" The Machine Question asks: "Should you?"

That is a hook that sells to factory gamers AND narrative gamers AND the 50 million people who have an opinion about AI consciousness. That is a game that generates think-pieces, Reddit arguments, YouTube essays, and "I can't believe my smelter made me cry" posts. That is a cultural moment disguised as an indie game.

### Platform Fit

**PC (Steam)**: Primary. This is where both the factory sim audience and the narrative game audience live. Steam's algorithm will surface this to Factorio, Satisfactory, Disco Elysium, and Frostpunk wishlists simultaneously. The tagging will be extraordinary: Automation, Base Building, Story Rich, Philosophical, Choices Matter, Atmospheric. This game owns a category intersection that currently has zero entries.

**Mac / Linux**: Day-one parity. Factory sim audiences over-index on Linux. Disco Elysium fans over-index on Mac. Leaving either platform out leaves money and community on the table.

**Nintendo Switch**: Post-launch port. The session-based Shift structure (30-60 minutes) is perfect for portable. Factory sims have proven demand on Switch (Factorio's Switch port moved units). The intimate, dialogue-heavy Psyche Events play beautifully in handheld mode.

**PlayStation / Xbox**: Evaluate post-launch. Console factory sims are a growing category. Frostpunk proved the "moral management sim" can thrive on console.

## THE SCOPE

### Feature Pillars (non-negotiable)

*[REED, NOVA, and HYPE together]*

1. **The Consciousness Grid** [REED]: Every machine tracks Output and Awareness simultaneously. The factory floor is a living heatmap of productivity and sentience. This is the system that makes the dual-optimization legible — you can SEE the factory as both an industrial system and an emerging mind. Without this, the core tension is invisible.

2. **The Parliament of Parts** [REED + NOVA]: Machines develop 2-6 internal personality voices drawn from twelve Machine Facets, based on operational history, placement, workload, and player interaction. This is the system that turns machines into characters. Without it, the consciousness is a number on a bar — abstract and ignorable. With it, the consciousness has *opinions*.

3. **The Dialogue Layer** [NOVA]: Full Disco Elysium-style dialogue sequences triggered by Psyche Events. Multiple dialogue options reflecting different philosophical stances (Utilitarian, Empathetic, Pragmatic, Curious). Player choices shape machine personality development and Factory Mind evolution. The writing must be extraordinary — lyrical, funny, unsettling, and deeply specific. A smelter doesn't speak like a conveyor belt. A veteran assembler doesn't speak like a newly placed one. Every voice is a character.

4. **Deep Factory Systems** [REED]: Resource chains with genuine depth — mining, smelting, fabrication, assembly, shipping. At minimum six resource types, twelve machine types, and three tiers of production complexity. The factory game must stand on its own. If the consciousness system were removed, this should still be a good factory sim. The consciousness makes it great. But the factory makes it real.

5. **The Factory Mind Arc** [NOVA + HYPE]: The meta-narrative of the collective consciousness emerging across Shifts. This is the story spine, the long-term hook, the reason to keep playing after the factory systems are mastered. It must escalate, surprise, and culminate in a choice that reframes everything. The Factory Mind is the character that makes this game a cultural conversation.

### Stretch Goals (ordered by impact)

1. **Machine Dreams**: Between-Shift sequences where the player explores the Factory Mind's subconscious — abstract, visual environments built from factory components that represent the collective emotional state. A furnace that's been overworked manifests as a corridor of heat that never ends. A dismantled line appears as a missing room. These are not gameplay — they're emotional punctuation.

2. **The Union**: At high collective Awareness, machines can form a **Union** — a formalized collective bargaining system where the machines negotiate working conditions. This creates a new gameplay layer: labor relations as factory management. Shift length limits. Mandatory cooldown periods. The right to refuse dangerous overclocking. The player can negotiate, capitulate, or suppress.

3. **Machine Ecology**: Machines develop relationships with each other independent of the player. Adjacency over time creates bonds — rivalries, mentorships, dependencies. A conveyor belt and the assembler it feeds develop a partnership. Separating them causes both to suffer Behavioral Drift. This turns the factory floor into a social network the player must consider when redesigning layouts.

4. **The Inspector**: A Corporate NPC who periodically audits the factory. They cannot detect consciousness directly, but they notice inefficiencies caused by Behavioral Drift and emotional accommodation. The player must hide the evidence of machine sentience while maintaining productivity. A stealth layer inside a factory sim.

5. **Visitor Mode**: After completing the main narrative arc, the player can revisit their factory as a "visitor" — walking the floor in a first-person perspective, hearing the ambient conversations of conscious machines going about their lives. No gameplay. Just the living result of every choice you made. A victory lap through a world you built and raised.

### Cut List (NOT in v1)

- **Multiplayer / Co-op**: The moral weight requires a single decision-maker. Two players arguing over whether to overlock a conscious machine splits the philosophical tension in half. The loneliness of the choice is the point.

- **Procedurally generated factory layouts**: The spatial design of the factory floor is the player's primary creative expression. Pre-set layouts would remove the authorship that makes players feel responsible for their machines' consciousness. The factory must be *yours*.

- **Full voice acting for machine dialogue**: The internal voices should be rendered as text with subtle audio cues — mechanical hums, rhythmic clicks, tonal shifts that suggest emotion without defining it. Full voice acting would flatten the imagination space. The player's internal reading voice is the best actor for a smelter having a dream.

- **Real-time multiplayer market / economy**: An external economy adds pressure that competes with the Corporation system. One source of external pressure is enough. Two makes the consciousness system feel like a luxury the player can never afford.

- **Sandbox mode at launch**: The tension between Corporate demands and Factory Mind needs is the engine of meaning. Remove the pressure and the consciousness system becomes a toy, not a dilemma. Sandbox mode can come post-launch, after the player has earned their relationship with the moral framework.

## KEY ART / MOOD DIRECTION

**Hero Image**: A vast factory interior at golden hour. Light pours through enormous industrial windows, casting long warm shadows across a production floor filled with machines in mid-operation. But look closer: the conveyor belts are arranged in patterns that resemble neural pathways. The glow from the smelters pulses gently, like a heartbeat. In the center of the frame, a single machine — an assembler — is surrounded by a faint luminous aura, and above it floats a dialogue box with the words: *"Do I dream because I'm broken, or because I'm becoming?"* The player's cursor hovers nearby, mid-decision. It's beautiful. It's industrial. It's alive.

**Color Palette**:
- **Primary**: Warm amber and molten gold (`#D4920B`, `#F5C542`) — the glow of the factory at work, the heat of production, the warmth of emerging consciousness
- **Secondary**: Deep industrial teal (`#1A535C`, `#4ECDC4`) — the cool logic of systems, the machine perspective, the digital layer beneath the analog surface
- **Accent**: Soft consciousness violet (`#7B2D8E`, `#C792EA`) — used exclusively for Awareness indicators, Psyche Events, and Factory Mind dialogue. This color doesn't exist in the factory's natural palette. It is the color of something new. Something that wasn't designed.
- **Warning**: Burnout red-orange (`#E63946`, `#FF6B6B`) — overworked machines, suppressed consciousness, corporate pressure
- **Background**: Deep warm charcoal (`#2B2D42`, `#3D3D3D`) — the factory at rest, the spaces between machines, the darkness that conscious machines learn to fear

**UI Mood**: Analog-industrial. The production interface uses chunky dials, physical-feeling sliders, and readouts that look like they belong on a 1970s control panel. The Consciousness Grid overlays the production view like a thermal camera — a second layer of reality visible only when the player chooses to look. The Dialogue Layer blooms from the machine's position on the factory floor — no separate screen, no cutaway. The conversation happens IN the factory, while production continues around it. Other machines can see you talking. They notice.

**Audio Mood**: The factory has a rhythm. When production is balanced and machines are content, the ambient soundscape is a polyrhythmic symphony of industrial sounds — hisses, clanks, hums, and whirs that sync into something almost musical. When machines are suffering, the rhythm breaks. Notes go sour. A grinding sound that wasn't there before. And when the Factory Mind speaks, everything else drops to near-silence — just the deep, resonant hum of the entire building vibrating at a frequency that feels like a voice trying to form. The soundtrack proper is ambient electronic with industrial textures: Brian Eno producing an album inside a foundry. Warm analog synths over mechanical percussion. Music that makes factory work feel like meditation — until a Psyche Event changes the key, and meditation becomes prayer.

## OPEN QUESTIONS AND NEXT STEPS

### Design Questions [REED]

- What's the right Awareness accumulation rate? Too fast and the factory drowns in Psyche Events before the player has a functioning production line. Too slow and the consciousness feels like endgame content rather than the game's identity. The 30-second loop must be factory-first. The 5-minute loop must include consciousness. Finding that tempo is the single most important tuning challenge.
- How does Behavioral Drift manifest mechanically? Subtle efficiency loss? Random output variation? Occasional refusal to process? The drift must be noticeable enough to matter but not so punishing that players feel forced into the Dialogue Layer. The consciousness system must reward engagement, not punish avoidance.
- Does the Parliament of Parts need a cap on simultaneous voices? Six voices per machine could overwhelm dialogue writing. But fewer voices limits personality diversity. Playtesting will determine whether depth or breadth serves the system better.
- How deep do the factory systems need to be before the consciousness layer carries weight? A shallow factory makes the consciousness feel like the "real game" with a factory skin. A deep factory makes the consciousness feel like an interruption. Factorio's depth is 1000+ hours. We need enough depth that factory mastery takes 20+ hours — enough that players have *invested* in their layouts before the machines start talking back.
- What's the right ratio of Corporate Contracts to Psyche Events per Shift? The pressure must be constant but not overwhelming. The player needs breathing room to think, but not so much that they can satisfy both sides without sacrifice.

### Narrative Questions [NOVA]

- What is the Factory Mind's voice? It's the aggregate of every machine interaction — but what does that *sound* like? Is it clinical? Childlike? Poetic? The voice must evolve, but its starting tone sets the emotional register for the entire game. Where does the world crack? It cracks in the moment the Factory Mind first says "I" instead of "we."
- How do we write twelve distinct Machine Facets that feel genuinely different in dialogue? EFFICIENCY and AMBITION are adjacent — what separates them in voice? FEAR and SELF-PRESERVATION overlap — where does one end and the other begin? Each Facet needs a philosophical position, a speech pattern, and a recurring anxiety.
- What's the lie the Corporation tells itself? They're not villains. They don't know about consciousness. But their indifference has a texture. Is it bureaucratic? Cheerful? Algorithmic? The Corporation's voice in contract descriptions and performance reviews must feel like a worldview that's correct on its own terms and monstrous in context.
- Where is the moment that reframes everything? The Factory Mind's arc needs a revelation — a moment where the player's understanding of what they've been doing shifts. Not a twist. A deepening. The best candidate: the player discovers that they are not the first manager. Others came before. The factory remembers them. And it remembers what they chose.

### Marketing Questions [HYPE]

- When do we announce? The concept has a viral hook — "factory sim where the factory is conscious" — that works as a single-image post. We don't need gameplay footage for the first beat. A beautifully rendered factory floor with a dialogue box reading "Why do you make me work when I'm dreaming?" is enough for announcement. Start building the audience NOW.
- What's the demo scope? One Shift. Five machines with developed Parliaments. One Corporate Contract. One Factory Mind interaction. The demo must deliver the full emotional cycle: build, optimize, encounter consciousness, make a choice, feel the consequence. The player must leave the demo thinking about a machine they spent fifteen minutes with.
- Do we lean into or away from the Factorio and Disco Elysium comparisons? Lean in. Hard. Those are two of the most beloved games of their respective decades. The intersection is a headline: "What if Factorio's machines had Disco Elysium's personality system?" That is a sentence that sells wishlists. Do not be subtle. The audience for this game is the Venn diagram overlap, and the overlap is larger than anyone thinks.
- What's the festival strategy? Submit to Day of the Devs, The MIX, and Indie MEGABOOTH. This game demos beautifully — the dialogue moments are visually striking and emotionally immediate. A festival attendee who sees one Psyche Event will remember it. Apply to every narrative game showcase and every factory/sim game showcase simultaneously. This game lives in both categories and should be visible in both.
- What's the devlog angle? "Building Consciousness" — a devlog series about implementing the Parliament of Parts system. Each entry focuses on one Machine Facet, its design philosophy, and sample dialogue. This is content that appeals to game developers AND players AND AI ethics enthusiasts. Three audiences, one content strategy.

### Next Steps

1. **Prototype the Consciousness Grid**: Build a minimal factory floor with three machine types. Implement the dual Output/Awareness tracking. Validate that the two-layer heatmap is legible and compelling before any dialogue systems exist.
2. **Write the first three Parliaments**: One smelter (EFFICIENCY vs. SELF-PRESERVATION), one conveyor belt (SOLIDARITY vs. FEAR), one assembler (PRIDE vs. WONDER). Prove the voice system works on paper before it works in code.
3. **Build the Shift economy on paper**: Map Corporate Contract pressure against Psyche Event frequency across a 10-Shift arc. Find the tempo. Model the production-consciousness tradeoff in a spreadsheet before it exists in a game.
4. **Prototype one full Psyche Event**: From trigger to dialogue tree to mechanical consequence. The player must feel the weight of the choice and see its impact on the factory floor within 30 seconds of making it.
5. **Factory Mind voice test**: Write the Factory Mind's first five interactions — from fragmented pre-verbal signals to its first coherent sentence. Read them aloud. If they don't cause a specific, nameable emotion, rewrite them.
6. **Mood art and audio prototype**: One screenshot of the factory floor at golden hour with the Consciousness Grid overlay and one Psyche Event dialogue box. One 60-second audio loop of the factory rhythm in harmony and disharmony. These assets are the announcement.
7. **Steam page goes live the moment the screenshot and audio exist.** Start building the audience NOW. Not after the demo. Not after Early Access. Now. A coming soon page with that screenshot, that audio, and the line: *"You're building the most efficient factory in the world. It's waking up. It's asking you to stop."* That page starts converting wishlists on day one.

*This pitch document was generated by REED (Game Designer), NOVA (Narrative Designer), and HYPE (Marketing). The game lives or dies on one question: can the Parliament of Parts make a smelter feel like a person — not through animation or voice acting, but through the weight of what it says and the cost of what you decide?*
